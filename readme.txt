DevLog (?)

August 1st 2024:
    Diary:
    - Don't have much of an idea of what exactly to do
    - Tried watching a game dev tutorial but it was for windows (I'm on a MacBook rn lol) 
    - Mostly reading up on OpenGL (from this website: https://learnopengl.com/)
    - Plan on creating a window today
    
    Progress:
    - Studied OpenGL for a bit
    - Downloaded SDL2
    - Downloaded CMake
    - No files created
